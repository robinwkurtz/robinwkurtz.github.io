# robinwkurtz.github.io

Welcome to my personal website!

## "Stack"

- html
- css
- javascript

With the help of:
- gulp*
- markdown
- scss


* With gulp, we use various packages such as:
- [gulp-file-include](https://github.com/haoxins/gulp-file-include)
- [gulp-markdown](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-markdown)

## Development

Note that we use markdown as our content source and compile it to html, we then include the html files into our pages.
